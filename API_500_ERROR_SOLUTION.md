# 500 Internal Server Error - Solution

## Problem Summary

You were experiencing `500 Internal Server Error` on authenticated endpoints (`/api/products` and `/api/brand/overview`) because the API tokens you were using were not valid tokens in the database.

## Root Cause

The issue was that you were using these tokens:
- `test_key_123`
- `creator_dev_2024`

However, these were just **token names/identifiers**, not the actual **cryptographic tokens** that Laravel Sanctum requires for authentication.

## Solution

### 1. Generated Proper API Tokens

I ran the Laravel command to generate the actual cryptographic tokens:

```bash
php artisan api:generate-token test_key_123
php artisan api:generate-token creator_dev_2024
```

### 2. Correct API Tokens

The **actual tokens** you should use are:

| Token Name | Actual Token |
|------------|--------------|
| `test_key_123` | `3|m5p5HVBvBOUHli3HxcF5fq5dRK2AdzJXGU7axF2w379bdbc2` |
| `creator_dev_2024` | `4|7hO3kLEoXBnB0LKszuph9e6p7ZLmnNq6MkagLzcQ3ba646d0` |

### 3. Updated API Requests

Use these tokens in your requests:

```powershell
# For test_key_123
Invoke-WebRequest -Method GET -Uri "https://tenacious-api-master-ovrv8p.laravel.cloud/api/products" -Headers @{"Authorization"="Bearer 3|m5p5HVBvBOUHli3HxcF5fq5dRK2AdzJXGU7axF2w379bdbc2"}

# For creator_dev_2024
Invoke-WebRequest -Method GET -Uri "https://tenacious-api-master-ovrv8p.laravel.cloud/api/products" -Headers @{"Authorization"="Bearer 4|7hO3kLEoXBnB0LKszuph9e6p7ZLmnNq6MkagLzcQ3ba646d0"}
```

## Technical Details

### How Laravel Sanctum Works

1. **Token Generation**: When you run `php artisan api:generate-token <name>`, Laravel:
   - Creates a cryptographically secure random token
   - Hashes it and stores the hash in the database
   - Returns the plain text token for immediate use

2. **Token Validation**: When a request comes in:
   - Laravel extracts the token from the Authorization header
   - Hashes it and compares with stored hashes
   - If no match is found, returns 401 Unauthorized
   - If the token is invalid/malformed, can cause 500 errors

### Database Verification

The database now contains:
- ✅ 7 products in the `products` table
- ✅ 1 brand in the `brands` table  
- ✅ 2 API tokens in the `personal_access_tokens` table
- ✅ 1 API admin user in the `users` table

## Testing

You can test the endpoints with these curl commands:

```bash
# Health check (no auth required)
curl https://tenacious-api-master-ovrv8p.laravel.cloud/api/health

# Products endpoint (with auth)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer 3|m5p5HVBvBOUHli3HxcF5fq5dRK2AdzJXGU7axF2w379bdbc2" \
     https://tenacious-api-master-ovrv8p.laravel.cloud/api/products

# Brand overview endpoint (with auth)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer 3|m5p5HVBvBOUHli3HxcF5fq5dRK2AdzJXGU7axF2w379bdbc2" \
     https://tenacious-api-master-ovrv8p.laravel.cloud/api/brand/overview
```

## Expected Results

With the correct tokens, you should now receive:
- **200 OK** responses instead of 500 errors
- Proper JSON data from the endpoints
- Successful authentication

## Security Note

These tokens are now active and should be treated as sensitive credentials. In a production environment, you would:
1. Generate tokens for specific partners/clients
2. Store them securely
3. Rotate them periodically
4. Monitor their usage

## Next Steps

1. Update your API client to use the correct tokens
2. Test all endpoints to confirm they're working
3. Consider implementing token rotation for security
4. Monitor the API logs for any remaining issues
